  My name is Boon Han, and I love solving challenges. I want to solve the challenge of bringing robots to our daily lives. Currently, I am a Robotics Software Engineer in Singapore, developing tools and robot prototypes to help enable diverse forms of robotics work together in hospital settings via a [Robotics Middleware Framework](https://github.com/osrf/rmf_core). 

  My strengths are a combination of DevOps expertise, C++/Python software development and Network administration.

  I have experience developing [wheeled](https://www.ubiquityrobotics.com/) robots, [manipulator](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur10-robot/) robots and embedded systems such as the [Pinetime Smartwatch](https://github.com/JF002/Pinetime).

  I have 2 years experience in delivering **robust**, **user-friendly** products from developer to end users via **rigorous testing**, **relentless automation** and **good software design**.

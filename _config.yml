  My name is Boon Han, and I love solving challenges. I want to solve the challenge of bringing robots to our daily lives. Currently, I am a Robotics Software Engineer in Singapore, developing tools and robot prototypes to help enable diverse forms of robotics work together in hospital settings via a [Robotics Middleware Framework](https://github.com/osrf/rmf_core). 

  My strengths are a combination of <mark>DevOps</mark> expertise, <mark>C++/Python</mark> software development and <mark>Networking</mark> administration.

  I have experience developing [wheeled](https://www.ubiquityrobotics.com/) robots, [manipulator](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur10-robot/) robots and embedded systems such as the [Pinetime Smartwatch](https://github.com/JF002/Pinetime).

  I deliver **robust** and **user-friendly** software from developer to end user by applying **rigorous testing** and **relentless automation**.

    During my time at UoE I learnt many key skills that have I have taken through my career, such as teamwork and working efficiently. I enthusiatically expanded my understanding of the complexity of robotics by taking multiple masters level courses in Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning and Robotics Motor Control. 

    I also had the great opportunity to do an internship and also my final year honours project in the [Statistical Learning and Motor Control](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/slmc) Robotics Lab headed by [Professor Sethu Vijayakumar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JdRs1sQAAAAJ&hl=en), which does cutting edge research in various aspects of robotic motor control.

    I was in the executive committee of the *Edinburgh University Singapore Society*, and organized various events related to Singaporean culture.

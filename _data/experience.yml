  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    My work is focused on operating, testing, debugging and maintaining multi-robot systems. This project is large and requires a significant scope of expertise. I am involved in almost all technical aspects, such as
      1. Development of [Robotics Middleware Framework](github.com/osrf/rmf_core) packages for various robots and infrastructure
      2. Network administration and troubleshooting
      3. Full stack development of autonomous mobile robots and manipulator robots
      4. Continuous Integration and automation methods
      5. Software maintenence to reduce technical debt and bit rot, and improve usability
      6. Creating reproducible bug reports 
      7. Gazebo simulation development
      8. Integration of various sensors and medical devices

    Through the projects I have also been able to **contribute to open source projects**:
      1. User interface for [`rmf_demos`](https://github.com/osrf/rmf_demos/pull/45)
      2. Debugging [`Fast-DDS`](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/issues/1261)
      3. Unit Tests for [`rmf_core`](https://github.com/osrf/rmf_core/pull/2)
      4. Improving Python bindings for [`rmf_fleet_adapter_python`](https://github.com/osrf/rmf_fleet_adapter_python/pull/6)

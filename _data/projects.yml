    A collection of gems to improve software/hardware development and testing.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I started this project to optimize development time. I often waste a large amount of time with repetitive work like typing boilerplate commands, googling for configurations, and consistently setting up new devices. This project aims to automate most of these inefficiencies away. 

    This toolbox can quickly bring up docker containers to simulate multi-device environments. It can set up WiFi hotspots, Remote Desktop servers and fire up development interfaces configured with all the necessary tools at a single click. These shortcuts have greatly increased my development flow and productivity.

    This project demonstrates my skills and practices in DevOps and Automation.

    A quick way to connect Bluetooth Low Energy devices to ROS2.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Bluetooth Low Energy is a promising technology due to its low power consumption, decent range and mesh capabilities. There is potential value in using these low cost, low energy devices for various use cases. This project expands a developers arsenal of tools for prototyping new ideas by providing a simple way to connect to BLE devices over the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) communication stack.
    
    This project demonstrates my experience with ROS2, Python and BLE technology.

    Near native performance over the Web, using C++ and WebAssembly
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    C++ is extremely powerful and versatile. However, it is challenging to distribute as it is architecture specific and has a complex build process. WebAssembly promises to handle this by allowing near-native performance in Web browsers. I am enthusiastically exploring the possibilities of WebAssembly, and curate my explorations in this ongoing project.
    
    This project demonstrates my experience with C++ and its build systems.

    Telegram Bot for easier Safe Entry Access
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Due to COVID-19, Singapore has implemented SafeEntry, a mandatory QR-Code based check-in system at most building entrances, in order to implement contact tracing. However, each person is required to manually scan a QR code, which is slow and slows down human traffic in crowded areas. This Telegram Bot idea aims to host an online database of QR codes, allowing an end user to type in their destination to retrieve the corresponding QR code, without having to stop and scan. This telegram bot is hosted on a Heroku free plan server, and is live at @SafeEntryBot ( try it! ).

    This project demonstrates my experience with quick prototyping and cloud based computations.
